> This BAPE hoodie is the staple of the company. Many people spend thousands of dollars to get their hands on resold versions of this hoodie. The original design is what keeps people buying. The hoodie is mostly used as a status symbol rather than purely for fashion. The main symbol of BAPE is it's camo, it does it in most of it's product and that's how you would easily tell if something is a BAPE product.

--------
> The Supreme T-Shirt is probably one of the most popular of the fashion brands. It is of the most simple design and goes for a clean white and red look. This shirt is supreme's icon item. Supreme likes to calloborate with other brands often as they do this to make certain items really rare. Any supreme collab goes for a lot of money.

# My Favorite!!!

## Off-White

Off-White is the best fashion brand in my opinion for the following reasons.

* BEST designs, the spinoffs of their designs bring new and creative ideas
* AMAZING collabs, their collabs always turn out good and they aren't afraid to collab with companies of different style apparal.
* BETTER brand, the logo and the clean look of their branding is brilliant.
